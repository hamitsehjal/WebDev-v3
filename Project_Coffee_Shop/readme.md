# Checkout Page for a Coffee Shop (*CSS Project*)

In this Project, I made a checkout page for a __Coffee Shop__. 
- It looks like this:

Some notes:


I got the logo for Coffee Masters from [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/images/coffee_masters_logo.png):

### Some key notes:
- Use border-radius to get rounded corners.
- There are many ways to do this Project. Flex and grid would work well, just don't go overboard with grid, it'd be hard to 100% handle this layout in just grid.
- HTML inputs can be styled with HTML just as you expect.
- You can give it the nice little shadow effect with the CSS property box-shadow.
- This Project contains around 130 lines of Html code and approx. 200 lines of Css. For this Project, I have strictly used only *Html* and *Css*.
- Again, you do not need to do it the way I did. There are infinite correct ways to do this.
- I ended up using grid for layout of entire WebPage.

### Adding a web font
You can add a font using Google Web Fonts (lots of ways to do it, Google's is easy) by adding this tag in the <head>
```bash

<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
and by adding font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; to whatever you want to change the font to be. You don't have to but it's pretty cool! [Check out Google Fonts][font] if you're curious.
