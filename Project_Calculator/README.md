# Project: Calculator

In this Project, I made a calculator on iOS! If you've never seen that before, here it is:

### Some key notes:

- This calculator functions like a normal calculator
- I did not implement % or .. I assumed everything will be an integer.
- C means clear. When a user clicks it, it clears everything and go back to the first state it was in when the page loaded.
- Doing the back arrow is like pressing backspace; it'll delete the last character typed. If it's clicked when there's only one digit, it sets the current number to be 0.
- Calculators tend to have some special behavior when you hit equals: if you type another number it erases the results and starts over.

### Adding a web font
You can add a font using Google Web Fonts (lots of ways to do it, Google's is easy) by adding this tag in the <head>
```bash

<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
and by adding font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; to whatever you want to change the font to be. You don't have to but it's pretty cool! [Check out Google Fonts][font] if you're curious.
