# My Personal Blog 

In this Project, We're making our personal blog by using just __Html__. 
Feel free to use the project for your practice. 

Here is the synopsis of my My Personal Blog designed using just __Html__

My blog has two pages: index.html and about.html

My __index.html__ has a title and a quick intro.
My index.html also has a link to about.html.


## Snapshots of "index.html "Webpage!!

- ![index.html](https://github.com/hamitsehjal/WebDev-v3/blob/main/Project_Blog/pics/blog_1.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

- ![index.html](https://github.com/hamitsehjal/WebDev-v3/blob/main/Project_Blog/pics/blog_2.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

#### I have included five posts on my Blog.

Each post has the following :
- A title
- An author
- The date it was posted (feel free to make up times)
- The text of the blog post. I used Lorem Ipsum to get some placeholider text.
- Home-image

My __about.html__ consists of the following:
- The name of my blog
- Random cool Image ðŸ˜Ž
- A few paragraphs about myself that includes a list of my recent jobs/schools/accomplishments.

### Snapshot of "about.html "Webpage!!

- ![about.html](https://github.com/hamitsehjal/WebDev-v3/blob/main/Project_Blog/pics/blog_3.png?raw=true "Optional Title")


IMP: Quick note on how to do an image: put the image in the same directory as the index.html and about.html and then put 
```bash
<img src="the-name-of-the-file.jpg" alt="a text description of what the image is for sight-impaired folks" /> 
```
to render the image.

This will mostly be black and white and that's okay. You can come back and restyle this later with CSS.
