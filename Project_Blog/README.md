# My Personal Blog 

In this Project, We're making our personal blog by using just __Html__. 
Feel free to use the project for your practice. 

Here is the synopsis of my My Personal Blog designed using just __Html__

My blog has two pages: index.html and about.html

My __index.html__ has a title and a quick intro.
My index.html also has a link to about.html.

I have included five posts on my Blog.

Each post has the following :
- A title
- An author
- The date it was posted (feel free to make up times)
- The text of the blog post. I used Lorem Ipsum to get some placeholider text.
- Home-image

My __about.html__ consists of the following:
- The name of my blog
- Random cool Image ðŸ˜Ž
- A few paragraphs about myself that includes a list of my recent jobs/schools/accomplishments.
